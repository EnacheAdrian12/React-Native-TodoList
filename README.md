# React-Native-TodoList

This repository contains a to-do list application built with React Native.

The app features both a light and dark mode, allowing the user to switch between the two according to their preference. The app includes an input for adding tasks and a button for adding tasks to the list. Each task in the list has a delete button for removing the task. The styles for the input, buttons, and list items are created to change depending on whether the light or dark mode is selected. The code also includes input validation to ensure the input is not empty when adding a task. This project was completed as part of an internshop job for React Native development.

Preview for the app:
